MODEL'S RESPONSE TO USER:
"I've successfully created issue WEBAPP-789 for the authentication problem. 

Based on the content analysis, I recommend setting this as a 'High' priority 
issue since authentication failures significantly impact user experience. I can 
also mark it as a 'Bug' type since this is clearly a defect.

Would you like me to apply these improvements? I can run:
‚Ä¢ update_issue(issue_id='WEBAPP-789', priority='High')  
‚Ä¢ update_issue(issue_id='WEBAPP-789', type='Bug')

This will help with proper issue tracking and prioritization."
